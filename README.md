# Financing the RAM cost of the **Cards & Tokens**'s core smart contract

## What is **Cards & Tokens** ?
  - It's an entertainment and self-diffusion platform where users can create collectible cards and thematic albums to fill and win tokens.  
    - In this platform content creators may publish great trading cards embedding their work on each card. Then sell, auction or give away copies of those cards for the rest of users to collect.
    - Cards will gain points as people interact with it throw likes, comments, categorizations and market stats. That makes the cards to level up.
    - The albums are the first type of minigame in which users may play using the copies they have.
    - The platform is a plugin-driven structure. Allowing other Dapps to implement all kind of plugins using the cards as the main gaming object.
  - This platform is designed to provide gamification services to other applications through its low-level **boardgamebox** module.
## Why does it need so much RAM ?
  - **Cards & Tokens** platform is a very high RAM consumer because users will collect NFT which are stored separately on memory.
  - This platform is planned to be implemented in such way that users don't have to worry about the technology behind (until certain threshold).
## Who benefit from this financing ?
  - The beneficiaries would be the users of **Cards & Tokens** because they will not have to run with the high RAM costs that the platform requires.
  - The main and biggest beneficiaries will be the new users, who despite having few resources to interact with the blockchain will still be able to interact with this platform and collect lots of cards.
  - **Cards & Tokens** will be fully developed on Telos chain. So, if it is successful (and I am very confident that it will be) it will attract many users to this network, which will greatly benefit the entire Telos community.
## Why go to a worker proposal ?
  - Given that "if **Cards & Tokens** is successful it would benefit the Telos community", it is prudent to ask the community itself for help to make this success even more likely.
  - Although I am working hard to form a company and be able to dedicate myself completely to this, I still do not have the financial resources to do it and I must work on something else (have a job) to cover the basic cost of living.
  - Throughout these last three months I have been able to save the extra earnings on my normal salary, in order to pay the cost of that RAM. However, I had the misfortune of being hacked in my account and all the funds that I had saved were stolen.
## How much is asked and for what exactly ?
  - Summary: 25,000.0000 TLOS
    - ~23K TLOS -> 200Mb RAM for two of the tree main smart contracts of the system (100Mb each).
    - ~3K TLOS -> for staking (CPU & BW) for both contracts.
  - More detailed:  
    - The entire system of **Cards & Tokens** consists of three smart contracts:
        - **cardsntokens**: implements the details of the application *per se* (cards, contnet, points, likes, album integration, prices, etc).
        - **boardgamebox**: implements abstract gamification services (profiles, authorship, ownership, items, containers and many more comming soon).
        - **vapaeetokens**: implements system tokens (CNT, and others to come). Plus some other features like: auto claim airdrop, token exchange and staking.
    - Because the total RAM cost for the contract **vapaeetokens** was not that high (less than 5Mb), I was able to pay it off completely from my own money. Both the cost of the airdrop (less than 3Mb) plus the cost of the memory to host the contract code (almost 2Mb).
    - However, I needed several months to raise the money to pay the cost of a reasonable amount of RAM for the entire system and unfortunately I lost everything when I was hacked. It was planned to buy 100M of RAM for each of the other two contracts (**cardsntokens** and **boardgamebox**) whose total cost in TLOS is less than 25K TLOS. The rest of the Tokens are planned to be staked for CPU and Band Width.
